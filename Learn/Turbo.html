       <h3>The Power Booster</h3>
        <img style="width:150px; height:140px;" src="../Photos/Turbo.png"/>
      <p style="text-align:center; margin: 15px 0; font-style: italic;">
        A turbocharger is one of the most popular ways to make a car faster without making 
        the engine bigger. It uses your car’s exhaust gases — the hot air that would normally 
        be wasted — to spin a turbine and push more air into the engine. More air = more oxygen
        = more fuel can burn = way more power.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div id="sub">
       <h3>How It Works</h3>
      <p style="text-align:center; margin: 15px 0; font-style: italic;">
       Exhaust gases leave the engine after combustion. Instead of going straight out the exhaust, 
       they pass through the turbo. The exhaust spins a turbine wheel on one side of the turbo.
       That turbine is connected by a shaft to a compressor wheel on the other side. The compressor 
       pulls in fresh air, squeezes (compresses) it, and sends it into the engine. Now your engine 
       is breathing way more air than it could on its own — that’s why it feels like a jet when 
       boost kicks in</p>
    </div>

       <h3>Why It's So Powerful</h3>
      <p style="text-align:center; margin: 15px 0; font-style: italic;">
       Recycles exhaust energy: instead of wasting it, the turbo uses it to make more power. 
       More efficient: small engines can make the same power as bigger ones. Better fuel economy 
       (sometimes): because you get power only when you need it. Huge tuning potential: change 
       boost pressure → instant power gains. Example: A 2.0L turbo engine can make the same power 
       as a 3.0L or even 3.5L engine. More boost = more power… but too much = engine boom.</p>

       <h3>Types of Turbos</h3>
      <img style="width:250px; height:200px;" src="../Photos/TurboType.png"/>
      <p style="text-align:center; margin: 15px 0; font-style: italic;">
       <b>Single Turbo</b><br/>Has one turbocharger for the entire engine. It uses all the 
       exhaust gases to spin one turbine. Easier, lighter, and cheaper to install. Boost builds 
       a bit slower (called turbo lag) because one turbo has to handle all the air. Great for 
       tuning — simple setup and easier to control.<br/><b>Twin Turbo</b><br/>Uses two turbos 
       instead of one. Each turbo handles half the engine’s cylinders (like one for each 
       bank in a V6 or V8). They work together to build boost faster and smoother. Feels more 
       responsive — boost comes on earlier and stronger.</p>
