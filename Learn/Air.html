       <h3>The Lungs of the Engine</h3>
      <p style="text-align:center; margin: 15px 0; font-style: italic;">
       Just like humans need air to breathe, engines need air to make power. The air 
       mixes with fuel and burns inside the cylinders to create energy.The job of the
      air intake system is to bring clean, cool air into the engine — the more air, 
      the better it performs. Cooler air = denser air = more oxygen → bigger 
      explosions → more power.</p>
    </div>
     <div id="sub">
       <h3>Air Filter</h3>
       <img style="width:150px; height:140px;" src="../Photos/Air1.png"/>
      <p style="text-align:center; margin: 15px 0; font-style: italic;">
       Works like a mask for your engine. It removes dirt, dust, and debris from the 
       air before it enters. A clean filter helps the engine “breathe” easily and stay
      healthy. A dirty or clogged filter can reduce power and hurt fuel efficiency.
      Upgrading to a “cold air intake” or performance filter can give your engine 
      more airflow and a better sound.</p>

       <h3>Throttle Body</h3>
       <img style="width:150px; height:140px;" src="../Photos/Throttle.png"/>
      <p style="text-align:center; margin: 15px 0; font-style: italic;">
       Think of it like the lungs’ opening. It controls how much air goes into 
       the engine when you press the gas pedal. When you press the pedal, the 
       throttle plate opens wider → more air rushes in → more power. Modern cars 
       use electronic throttle control (no cable, just sensors). A larger throttle 
       body can help engines that are tuned or boosted flow more air.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="sub">
       <h3>Intake Manifold</h3>
       <img style="width:150px; height:140px;" src="../Photos/Manifold.png"/>
      <p style="text-align:center; margin: 15px 0; font-style: italic;">
       After passing the throttle, air enters the intake manifold. Its job is to split 
       the air evenly so every cylinder gets the same amount. This makes the engine run 
       smooth and balanced. It’s usually made from metal or plastic and shaped for airflow 
       efficiency. Performance intake manifolds are designed to flow more air and improve 
       high-RPM power.</p>
