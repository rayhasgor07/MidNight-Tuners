       <h3>Cooling System</h3>
      <p style="text-align:center; margin: 15px 0; font-style: italic;">
        Engines get really hot when running — we’re talking over 200°C (400°F) inside the cylinders. 
        If that heat isn’t managed, metal parts expand, oil breaks down, and the engine can overheat 
        or even seize. That’s where the cooling system steps in — its job is to pull heat away from 
        the engine and keep it running at the perfect temperature. It’s basically the car’s temperature 
        control system, constantly moving coolant through the engine and radiator to keep things balanced.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="sub">
       <h3>Radiator</h3>
      <img style="width:170px; height:170px;" src="../Photos/Radiator.png"/>
      <p style="text-align:center; margin: 15px 0; font-style: italic;">
        The radiator is like the car’s heat exchanger. Hot coolant from the engine flows through 
        thin metal tubes in the radiator, and air passing through (while driving or from the fan) 
        cools it down before sending it back to the engine. Think of it as the “lungs” of your 
        cooling system — it breathes out heat.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="sub">
      <h3>Water Pump</h3>
      <img style="width:170px; height:170px;" src="../Photos/WaterPump.png"/>
      <p style="text-align:center; margin: 15px 0; font-style: italic;">
        The water pump keeps the coolant flowing, like a heart pumping blood. It pushes coolant 
        from the engine to the radiator and back again. Usually driven by a belt from the engine, 
        or sometimes electrically powered in newer cars. No water pump = no coolant flow = instant 
        overheating.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="sub">
      <h3>Thermostat</h3>
      <img style="width:170px; height:170px;" src="../Photos/Thermostat.png"/>
      <p style="text-align:center; margin: 15px 0; font-style: italic;">
        The thermostat acts like a “temperature gate.” When the engine is cold, it stays closed, 
        keeping coolant inside the engine to warm it up faster. Once it reaches the right 
        temperature, it opens, allowing coolant to flow through the radiator to remove heat.
        Helps the engine warm up quickly and stay at the ideal temp for best performance 
        and fuel efficiency.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="sub">
      <h3>Cooling Fan</h3>
      <img style="width:170px; height:170px;" src="../Photos/CoolingFan.png"/>
      <p style="text-align:center; margin: 15px 0; font-style: italic;">
        When the car isn’t moving, no air passes through the radiator — that’s where the fan kicks 
        in. It pulls or pushes air through the radiator to cool it down even while you’re idling in 
        traffic. Some fans are electric (controlled by sensors), others are belt-driven on older cars.
        The fan is your “backup breeze” when you’re not speeding down the road.</p>
