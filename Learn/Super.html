       <h3>Instant Power, No Lag</h3>

        A supercharger is like a turbo’s older, louder, and more aggressive cousin. Instead of 
        using exhaust gases, it’s powered directly by the engine’s belt, which means the power 
        boost happens instantly — no delay, no waiting for boost. That’s why supercharged cars 
        hit hard the moment you press the gas.</p>

    <div id="sub">
       <h3>How It Works</h3>
      <p style="text-align:center; margin: 15px 0; font-style: italic;">
        The engine’s crankshaft belt spins the supercharger. Inside, it uses rotors or screws 
        to compress incoming air. The compressed (high-pressure) air goes straight into the engine.
        More air = more fuel = instant extra power every time you press the pedal. Unlike a turbo, 
        a supercharger doesn’t wait for exhaust gases — it’s always on, giving constant boost as 
        long as the engine is running. Since it runs off the engine’s power, it’s a bit less 
        fuel-efficient than a turbo.</p>

       <h3>Types of Superchargers</h3>
      <img style="width:250px; height:170px;" src="../Photos/SuperType.png"/>
      <p style="text-align:center; margin: 15px 0; font-style: italic;">
       <b>Screw</b><br/>Looks similar to a Roots, but inside it’s smarter. Uses two spiral-shaped 
       rotors that compress the air inside the housing. More efficient, makes denser, cooler air, 
       and gives instant power too. Sounds smoother but still has that high-pitched whistle. Think 
       of it as an upgraded, modern version of the Roots supercharger.<br/><b>Centrifugal</b><br/>
       Works more like a belt-driven turbocharger. Uses a spinning impeller (fan) to suck and 
       compress air. Boost builds gradually with RPM — less power down low, but crazy top-end pull.
       Smaller and lighter, often easier to install on compact engines. Think of it as a “supercharger 
       that feels like a turbo.”<br/><b>Roots</b><br/>The oldest and most iconic type (you’ve seen it 
       sticking out of muscle car hoods).Works like two interlocking gears that push air directly 
       into the intake manifold. Gives instant boost — no lag at all. But, it’s less efficient at high 
       RPM (creates heat and eats some power). Known for that classic whine sound and instant torque hit.</p>
